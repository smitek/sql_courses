Symmetric Pairs -> You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
                Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
                Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

SELECT F1.X, F1.Y
  FROM FUNCTIONS F1, FUNCTIONS F2
  WHERE F1.X = F2.Y AND F2.X = F1.Y
  GROUP BY F1.X, F1.Y
  HAVING COUNT(F1.X)>1 OR F1.X<F1.Y
  ORDER BY F1.X;

Interviews -> Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are .
            Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds  screening contest.

Draw The Triangle 1 -> P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):
                    Write a query to print the pattern P(20).

SET @NUMBER = 21;
SELECT REPEAT ('* ',@NUMBER := @NUMBER -1)
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;

Draw The Triangle 2 -> P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):
                    Write a query to print the pattern P(20).

SET @NUMBER = 0;
SELECT REPEAT ('* ', @NUMBER := @NUMBER +1)
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    LIMIT 20;

Print Prime Numbers -> Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand () character as your separator (instead of a space).
                    For example, the output for all prime numbers  would be:

SET @prime = 1;
SET @divisor = 1;

SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(a SEPARATOR '&') 
FROM
    (SELECT @prime := @prime + 1 AS a       
    FROM information_schema.tables t1, information_schema.tables t2             
    LIMIT 1000) list_of_potential_primes
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM
        (SELECT @divisor := @divisor + 1 AS b 
        FROM information_schema.tables t3, information_schema.tables t4
        LIMIT 1000) list_of_divisors
    WHERE MOD(a, b) = 0 AND a != b);

SQL Project Planning -> You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.
                      If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.
                      Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.

...

Placements -> You are given three tables: Students, Friends and Packages. Students contains two columns: ID and Name. Friends contains two columns: ID and Friend_ID (ID of the ONLY best friend). Packages contains two columns: ID and Salary (offered salary in $ thousands per month).
            Write a query to output the names of those students whose best friends got offered a higher salary than them. Names must be ordered by the salary amount offered to the best friends. It is guaranteed that no two students got same salary offer.

15 Days of Learning SQL -> Julia conducted a  days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.
                        Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least  submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.
