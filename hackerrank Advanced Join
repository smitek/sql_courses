Symmetric Pairs -> You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
                Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
                Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

SELECT F1.X, F1.Y
  FROM FUNCTIONS F1, FUNCTIONS F2
  WHERE F1.X = F2.Y AND F2.X = F1.Y
  GROUP BY F1.X, F1.Y
  HAVING COUNT(F1.X)>1 OR F1.X<F1.Y
  ORDER BY F1.X;
